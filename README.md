MusicPlayer-YoutubeDownloader


Winforms app that puts together a media player, Spotify colors(in dark theme) and a similar playlist sytem but with folders, Youtube's browser(Youtube webpage, when you select a video you can download its video or just the audio) and youtube downloaders.  To create a playlist create a folder in download path


Note that to use it you'll have to build it (Visual Studio recommended), you'll also need to delete 2 files from the solution(if I deleted them and then upload it i got 1000+ errors xd) they are settings1.cs and a temporary key(you will know that its them because they will appear with a blank file icon)
